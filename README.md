# unity3d-utils

Unity3D utils.

**All those utils can be managed via [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) / [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)!**

## Getting Started

1. Install [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/).
2. Create a folder in your Unity3D project, e.g. `Assets/Modules/`.
3. In that folder, run `yarn init -y`.
4. Now you can install those utils, e.g. `yarn add "https://gitpkg.now.sh/DiscreteTom/unity3d-utils/General/LayerMaskExtension?layer-mask-extension-0.1.0"`
5. After installation, you can use the utils in your project!
